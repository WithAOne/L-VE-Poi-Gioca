# LÖVE Poi Gioca
An ecs for LÖVE. It's simple and just something I whipped together to start off with ecss. I put it on GitHub for whatever reason


LÖVE Poi Gioca is a simple ecs initially made just as practice but since I use it in everything I decided to upload it.
This ecs is based in the LÖVE framework and is intended to be used with it but theoretically it could be used just with lua (as of 0.1 at least).

# ecs.lua
This lua file is everything the system works of--only forty-four lines of code (or thirty-seven if you remove blank lines). It's very simple and I didn't add any comments since I feel it's pretty self explainitory. 


"LÖVE Poi Gioca" means "LÖVE then Play" in italian, just a bit of trivia. There's no reason it's in italian, it just sounds cool to me.
